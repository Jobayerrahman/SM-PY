# Single-line comment in Python
# Comments are ignored by Python and help explain the code

print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment (end of line comment)


# ---------------------- Multi-line Comments ----------------------

# Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments.
# The common way is to use multiple single-line comments like this.


"""
Another way to write multi-line comments is using triple quotes.
This works because Python ignores string literals that are not assigned to a variable.
This method is often used for documentation or explanations.

'''
Triple single quotes also work the same way for multi-line comments.
Use whichever you prefer.
