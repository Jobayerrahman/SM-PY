"""

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them.

There is no need to declare a variable type (like var, let, const in JavaScript).

Python variables are dynamic, meaning they can change type after assignment.

"""

x = 5  # x is of type int
y = "Apple"  # y is of type str (string)

print(x)
print(y)
