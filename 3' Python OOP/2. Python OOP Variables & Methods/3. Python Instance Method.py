âœ… What is an Instance Method?

- An instance method is a function defined inside a class that works with instance variables (data unique to each object).

    -- It always takes 'self' as the first parameter.

    -- It can access both instance variables and class variables.

    -- It is the most common type of method used in classes.

    # Constructor - initializes instance variables
    def __init__(self, account_holder, balance):

        self.balance = balance  # instance variable

    # Instance Method
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"{amount} deposited. New balance is {self.balance}")

    # Another Instance Method

            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"{amount} withdrawn. Remaining balance is {self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient balance!")
